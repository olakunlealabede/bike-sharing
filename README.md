# bikesharing
Visualization using Tableau to analyze New York bike-sharing data.

# Project Overview
In this analysis, use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

# Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

You’ll use Pandas to change the datatype of the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours and minutes. Using Tableau instead of Pandas to change the datatype of the "tripduration" column to a "Date and Time" will not produce the same visualizations in Deliverable 2.

# Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:

How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.

How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.

A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
